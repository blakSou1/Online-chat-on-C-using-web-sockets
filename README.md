I did a small project to gain new skills, in which I implemented a simple messenger using the C# language and a web connection socket
in the file -ClientMax.xaml- you can find the layout of the client part
in the folder -ClientMax.xaml.cs- the main client code
and in the folder -Program.cs- the server code of this messenger is located

*do not think that this is a ready-made project, it has minimal functionality for a working application, but do not hesitate to use my code if you want
